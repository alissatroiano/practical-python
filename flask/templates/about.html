	Street art is a form of artwork that is displayed in public on surrounding buildings, on streets, trains, and on
	other publicly viewed surfaces. Many instances come in the form of guerrilla art, which is intended to make a
	personal statement about the society that the artist lives within. The work has moved from the beginnings of
	graffiti and vandalism to new modes where artists work to bring messages, or just beauty, to an audience.
	<br>
Street art has received artistic recognition with the high-profile status of Banksy and other artists. This has led street art to become one of the 'sights to see' in many European cities. Some artists now provide tours of local street art and are able to share their knowledge, explaining the ideas behind many works, the reasons for tagging and the messages portrayed in a lot of graffiti work. Berlin, London, Paris, Hamburg and other cities all have popular street art tours running all year round.
